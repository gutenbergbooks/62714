  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Betsey was a curly-headed little girl,
nine years old, who played with her
dolls in the most interesting way you
ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight, with
her soft brown hair and beautiful
brown eyes, was Betsey’s very dearest
doll, and she played most of the time
with her, and her charming little husband,
Mr. Delight. But Betsey’s sister
Anne, who was away at school
and who was much too old to play
with dolls any more, had given Mr.
and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did
seem too bad to keep them packed
away in their dark, stuffy box.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now, Betsey didn’t call herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>the dolls’ mother, for they were all
grown up, and much older than she was
already. And they seemed to need a
new chair or a new bed so very often,
that a carpenter was necessary most of
the time. So whenever Mr. Delight
wished to order new furniture, Betsey
called herself Mr. Betts, and talked
exactly like a carpenter. When Mrs.
Delight needed new dresses or new
curtains, Betsey called herself Madame
Bettina, and talked as nearly as she
could like Mother’s French dressmaker.
And when any of the dolls
were sick, Betsey at once took the
part of old Dr. Betson, and talked
gruffly with them about tonics and
pills.</p>

<p class='c012'>She talked for each of the dolls, too,
and if you had listened in the next
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>room, you would have said that at
least three or four people were talking.</p>

<p class='c012'>Betsey really was such a very skilful
little carpenter and seamstress, that
you will find only five pieces of furniture
in the pictures that she did not
make all alone by herself. See if you
can find the five things. She even
made Dinah, the colored cook.</p>

<p class='c012'>Betsey always liked School-time,
and Bed-time. And she was a very
good little girl about Errand-time
and Dusting-time,—considering everything.
But, do you know, I really
think that most of her best lessons
in patience and neatness were learned
in Play-time!</p>

    <div>THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>Chapter I<br /> THE NEW HOUSE</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>Mother paused on her way
past the playroom door, and
listened. She knew Betsey did not
have company, and yet there was a
sound of three voices,—first a pleasant
deep, bass voice, and then a
pleasant silvery little voice, and then
a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed
open the door very softly and looked in.</p>

<p class='c012'>There lay Betsey on the great fur
rug, with her curly head propped up
on her hand. Before her stood the
low, broad Morris chair, divided into
two rooms. Mother knew it must be
a bedroom at the back, on account of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>the funny bed made of a box-cover,
and covered with a gay patchwork
quilt, Betsey’s very first piece of sewing.
And nobody could possibly mistake
the dining-room in front, with its
large red pasteboard table, and little
Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute
little husband at the other. Black
Dinah stood by the table, smiling as
usual, ready to serve a large platter of
salad, and Dumpling Delight barked
gruffly once in a while, because there
were so many tantalizing smells in the
air.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Will you have a breaded chop, my
dear?” asked Mr. Delight.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, thank you, William. Will you
have some of the creamed oysters?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And some of dis yeah lobster
salad?” inquired Dinah.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_004f.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“WILL YOU HAVE A BREADED CHOP, MY DEAR?”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>(“Mercy,” thought Mother, behind
the door, “what a dinner!”)</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll tell you what <i>I</i> wish,” said Mr.
Delight with a deep cough, “I wish
we could invite your sister Prudence
and her husband to spend a week
with us.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where in name hebben would you
put comp’ny, now, Massa Willyum?
I ask you dat,” demanded Dinah.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, William!” echoed Mrs. Delight.
“This house is certainly a tight
fit for three, and with two extra ones!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wish I could afford a larger
house,” said Mr. Delight in a worried
tone.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My dear husband!” exclaimed
Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up
straight on the rug and take Mrs.
Delight around the table to kiss her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>husband affectionately. “I didn’t mean
a word I said, William; I really
didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There, there, my dear, I know
you didn’t,” replied Mr. Delight
soothingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>But Mother suspected that Mr. Delight
was worried just the same, so she
softly pulled the door together and
tiptoed away to the telephone. She
smiled to herself as she called up the
carpenter-shop.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I want you to make my daughter
Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,” she
said. “Just like the one you made for
your little girl,—that had four rooms
and six windows, and a big door between
the rooms. And <i>can</i> you get it
done for Betsey’s birthday? In four
days?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>“I will get it done, paint and all,”
promised Mr. Jones. And he did.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the morning of her ninth birthday,
Betsey came smiling to breakfast,
expecting to see a pile of dainty white
parcels at her plate.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your birthday present is up in the
playroom, Betsey dear,” said Mother
with a kiss.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m afraid she won’t like it,” said
Father.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now, whenever Father said that,—“I’m
afraid she won’t like it,”—Betsey’s
present was sure to be very large
and wonderful. Once it had been her
shiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom,
and once her darling black pony.
So Betsey finished her breakfast in
great excitement, hurried upstairs to
the playroom and pushed open the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>door. And there it stood in the center
of the room,—the dear little house,
painted snow-white inside and pale
green outside,—with four rooms and
six windows and tiny window-sashes,
and the cunningest threshold!</p>

<p class='c012'>Betsey rushed over to the dainty little
cottage, put her head in the little
dining-room and looked through the
double doors into the drawing-room.
“Just to see how it would seem to live
here,” she thought. And then her
eyes fell on a square white card dangling
from one of the little window-sashes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT”
said the card. “To Betsey, from Father
and Mother.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll say thank you before I begin
to play,” decided Betsey, tossing back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>her curls and clattering down-stairs at
a great rate.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here’s that child!” exclaimed
Father. “I was <i>afraid</i> she wouldn’t
like it!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“O but she does!” shouted Betsey,
whirling around in the middle of the
room. “Mr. Delight has wanted to
move for the longest while!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What do you say, Mother,” said
Father with a twinkle, “if we excuse
Betsey today from doing any hard
work?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Betsey can simply make her bed,”
agreed Mother.</p>

<p class='c012'>So Betsey whisked the white covers
over her little brass bed as smoothly as
she could (with a perfectly new doll-house
waiting), and hurried back to the
House of Delight.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Little Mr. Delight was sitting in his
law office behind the radiator. Betsey
picked him up, put on his gray derby
hat, and walked him rapidly across the
room to the Morris chair.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Edith, O Edith!” he cried excitedly.
“My salary has been raised to
a million dollars a year! Now we can
move into a new house!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How perfectly lovely!” cried Mrs.
Delight. “Can’t we buy one directly?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We certainly can, my dear,” replied
Mr. Delight. “We will go down
right away and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter,
and see what houses he has on
hand for sale.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Betsey slipped off the excited little
gentleman’s business coat and put on
his black one with the long tails, thrust
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>his cane under his arm, and propped
him up against the chair-back to wait
for Mrs. Delight, who was much slower
in dressing. Betsey selected a white
silk blouse and tailored skirt for Mrs.
Delight, and opened her gay Japanese
parasol. Then, while the happy dolls
were taking the trolley ride to Mr.
Betts’ carpenter-shop—(really standing
stiffly all the time against the
chair-back)—Betsey hustled the untidy shop
into order. Then she drew the table
over to the window, settled her fat tube
of paste, her bottle of glue, her scissors
and scraps of satin on it, and sat down
before it, very importantly, as Mr.
Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling
carpenter she was!</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good day, Mr. Betts,” said Mr.
Delight (quite out of breath with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>stairs), “we want to buy a new
house.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What kind of a house?” asked
Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little
customers up against a pile of books.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A moderately large house, Mr.
Betts,” replied Mr. Delight, “that is
well-built,—for myself, my wife, and a
colored cook.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Aha!” exclaimed Mr. Betts. “I
have the very house!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Shall we take a look at it, my dear?”
said Mr. Delight, offering his arm to
his wife. And presently they stood in
Mr. Betts’ brand new house, that was
painted snow-white inside and pale
green outside, that was well-built and
just right for three people.</p>

<p class='c012'>“O what a lovely house!” exclaimed
Mrs. Delight.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“How much is it?” asked Mr.
Delight, taking out his check-book.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is $15,000, but it is <i>very</i> well-built
and—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That is quite satisfactory to me,
Mr. Betts,” said Mr. Delight, calmly
writing his check for $15,000.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And you can supply us with furniture,
I suppose?” asked Mr. Delight,
passing the check to the obliging
carpenter.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Everything from a rocking-chair to
a telephone,” said Mr. Betts happily.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Betsey!” called Mother’s voice.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here is a present from Aunty, for
your birthday,” said Mother when
Betsey opened the door.</p>

<p class='c012'>Betsey sat right down on the stairs,
smoothed out the long, pink ribbon
carefully (for she was sure to need it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>when she became Madame Bettina, the
French dressmaker), and shook out
her present. It was a tiny sideboard
with shelves for Mrs. Delight’s china,
with fascinating doors that opened and
shut, each set with a little silver-colored
knob.</p>

<p class='c012'>“O for my new house!” cried
Betsey. “Isn’t it the luckiest thing,
Mother, for I’m afraid Mr. Betts doesn’t
keep sideboards!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mother laughed and waved her hand
at the happy little figure.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, as long as the house is decided
upon,” said Mr. Betts cheerfully,
taking one of the little millionaires in
each hand, and sitting down at his
work-table, “I suppose the next thing
is furniture.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_014f.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“THAT IS QUITE SATISFACTORY TO ME, MR. BETTS,” SAID MR. DELIGHT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>“We want everything,” declared
Mr. Delight recklessly. “We want a
piano, and a window-seat, and a sideboard—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have a sideboard that came in
this morning,” interrupted Mr. Betts,
rolling it out directly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“O isn’t it sweet?” said Mrs. Delight,
clasping her hands. “Dinah and
I will paper the shelves with that scalloped
paper that comes on purpose.
Think of it, William, full of our wedding
china!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Betsey! O Betsey!” called Tom,
plunging up the stairs. “See what
I’ve got.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Betsey turned around and examined
with interest a piece of gilt molding
about six inches long that Tom held out.</p>

<p class='c012'>“See, lay it on this side, and presto!
it’s a sofa! You can have it.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>“O Tom, how kind of you! I’ll
make a huckaback pillow for it,—pink
and green. It will be too dear for
anything!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hum,” thought Tom on his way
down-stairs. “I didn’t think she’d be
so awfully pleased with a little thing
like that. Maybe I could saw her
out a little chair on my jig-saw—I
wonder?”</p>

<p class='c012'>And in a few minutes there was a
strange, buzzing sound down cellar,
that kept time to the hum of Madame
Bettina’s tiny sewing-machine upstairs.
For it was Madame Bettina that had
to make the sheets and pillow-cases
and net curtains, and all the things
which are hardly in a carpenter’s
line.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How <i>can</i> I make a telephone?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>puzzled Betsey. And she gazed
thoughtfully at her box of beads.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Aha!” exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly,
taking two large silver beads
from his box.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ho-ho!” he laughed, rummaging
excitedly in the closet where he kept
his smooth pieces of kindling wood.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, Mr. Delight,” he remarked
calmly, “I will personally see to it
that the telephone is put in the very
first thing, so you won’t lose an
important call.” He began to paint
a small piece of wood a rich, deep
brown, with water colors.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Another small piece of wood for
a battery box,” murmured Betsey,
whanging away at an obstinate nail.
“The two silver beads for bells, a
two-pointed tack to hold the receiver—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>green cord—a roll of black paper
stuck into a black bead for a receiver—.
Now, what on earth for a
speaking tube?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Speaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly
took the cap from his tube
of paste, and with one resounding rap
of his hammer, nailed it securely in
the exact center of the new telephone!</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hullo, up there!” called a deep
voice at the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come up, come up!” called Betsey,
running to open the door for
her father. “See the telephone.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, quite a telephone, indeed!”
said Father admiringly. “Now, what
can you do with this?” He laid a
polished wooden stamp-box in her
hand.</p>

<p class='c012'>Betsey thought a moment. “A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>clock. Glue the cover down, paint
a lace, stick on a pendulum—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And hang it on the wall!” finished
Father. And he smiled over
his shoulder to see Betsey change so
suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must
somehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather’s
clock,—solid oak, keeping
perfect time, and extremely reasonable
in price.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you want to live in your new
house at once, or wait until everything
is done?” asked Mr. Betts.</p>

<p class='c012'>“O live there at once, William!”
pleaded Mrs. Delight. “I am just
crazy to hang the curtains!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“O.K.,” said Mr. Delight. “You
get Dinah to come over to help you,
and I will superintend Mr. Betts and
his moving men.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Soon the tiny drawing-room was in
great confusion. Dinah and her mistress
sat among great piles of net and
lace, running the dainty curtains on
their poles, tying them back with
wide rose-colored ribbons, and getting
up and down on the step-ladder to
arrange the folds. Suddenly, as Betsey
swung Mrs. Delight gently from
the little ladder, a tiny elastic between
Mrs. Delight’s arms snapped, and
down fell her round right arm on
the soft new carpet!</p>

<p class='c012'>“Massa Willyum!” shrieked Dinah.
“Miss Edith done broke her
arm a-falling off dis yeah step-ladder!
Telephone for de doctor, wid de new
telephone!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Delight rushed distractedly to
the telephone. “Dr. Betson, please
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>come <i>immediately</i>! Yes, my wife has
broken her arm. It’s very serious
indeed!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will come just as soon as my
motor can get there,” replied Dr.
Betson.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dinah was wringing her hands and
crying when Mr. Delight hurried into
the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t feel so badly, Dinah,” said
Mrs. Delight bravely. “Dr. Betson
is the best surgeon in the world.”
And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson
rang the bell violently.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, well!” he said heartily,
kneeling down to examine the break.
“Don’t worry, Mrs. Delight, because
I can fix this arm in a trice! Just
spread a few blankets on the floor for
a comfortable bed and I’ll go to work.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Betsey pulled a piece of new elastic
(kept for just this purpose) out of
her work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight’s
arms on, and tied them tight. And
then to make her work look quite
professional, she bandaged the right
arm beautifully with cheese cloth.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is it possible the arm is set?”
asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put
up his instruments (a ribbon-runner
and a pair of blunt scissors).</p>

<p class='c012'>“All done, Madam,” declared Dr.
Betson. “This is a very fortunate
kind of break. Now that it is properly
set, you do not even need to be
careful. I would suggest that you
take a good rest, however.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>“SHE ALWAYS STOOD MR. DELIGHT UP IN HIS SHIRT-SLEEVES, TO SUPERINTEND THINGS IN GENERAL”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>“Indeed she will!” agreed Mr.
Delight shaking hands with the gruff
doctor. He was still quite pale.
“Now, as soon as I can move Mrs.
Delights bed up to her room, we
will all go to bed, for we are very
much exhausted with moving.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Betsey carefully slipped on Mrs.
Delight’s long, lacy night-dress, and
tucked her in gently, and soon she
was asleep.</p>

<p class='c012'>And soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling
asleep, and tiptoed up to bed,
and soon <i>he</i> was asleep. As for
Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes.
So the tall, shiny clock on the wall
ticked through the night alone, for
Betsey crept happily into her own
white bed, and fell asleep herself,
for she had worked hardest of all!</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>Chapter II<br /> AT THE SEASHORE</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>“What are you making, Betsey?”
asked Tom, one hot
July day.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A cottage,” said Betsey.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Whew! There’s nothing small
about you! What do you want of
a cottage when you’ve got a new
doll-house?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mrs. Delight has to have a summer
home, hasn’t she?” answered Betsey
with dignity. “O Tom, dear! <i>Could</i>
I borrow your train of cars? The
Delights want to go to the seashore.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You can <i>have</i> it. I don’t want
it any more.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>“O thank you, Tom. I don’t suppose
you’d want to lend that little
suit-case—that Uncle John gave you
full of candy, would you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That,” said Tom, solemnly making
a great bow, “you may have,
too. What do <i>I</i> want of a <i>doll’s</i>
suit-case?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’re an old dear,” said Betsey
affectionately. “Now let me think
what else I need to make before the
families can start for the beach.” She
cut a large window in her pasteboard
cottage as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How many families are going?”
inquired Tom politely.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Two,” said Betsey, carefully marking
her window-sashes. “Mr. and
Mrs. Delight, and Dinah and Dumpling,
for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Darling for the other. Try to think,
Tom, what I ought to make.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are your families going swimming?”
asked Tom.</p>

<p class='c012'>“O yes, indeed, every day.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then I suggest that you make
bathing-suits.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course! How stupid of me!
Here I am, planning too much about
trains and cottages, and not at all
about clothes!”</p>

<p class='c012'>And Tom went down-stairs, just
as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished
his cottage, and changed into Madame
Bettina, the French dressmaker.</p>

<p class='c012'>“O Madame Bettina!” said Mrs.
Delight all out of breath. “We want
some bathing-suits made. We’re
going to the seashore!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That is ver’ good,” said Betsey,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>with Madame Bettina’s French accent
(just as Mother’s dressmaker
talked). “Will you have Alice-blue
suits trimmed with white braid, with
charming bath caps to match?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That sounds very pretty,” agreed
Mrs. Delight. “My sister doesn’t
know yet that she’s going, so hers
is a great surprise. Make hers blue
and mine black, so we can tell them
apart, and Dinah must have one
too.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I shall send them tonight, surely,”
said Madame Bettina, getting to work
in good earnest, for it is not every
dressmaker that can make five bathing-suits
in one day. She cut here
and snipped there, and ran her machine
at a great rate.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Betsey!” called Mother above all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>the noise. “Come to the head of the
stairs a minute.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Betsey stopped her noise obediently
and opened the door.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tom and I are going to Boston
at ten o’clock. Norah will take care
of you. And you can ask Mary to
come over to play this afternoon, if
you want to.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t need Mary, Mother!”
cried Betsey laughing. “You see
with Mrs. Delight’s company I have
my hands full already.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very well,” said Mother laughing
too. “Now what do you want me
to bring you? I’m going to take
your gold thimble in to be straightened
where the chair rocked on it.”
She held up the tiny blue box.</p>

<p class='c012'>“O Mother <i>dear</i>! If you’ll only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>take the thimble in something else,
and give me that thimble box, you
don’t have to bring me one thing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What do you want it for?” asked
Mother in a puzzled tone.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A camera. It’s <i>just</i> the size. I’ll
cover it with black oilcloth and make a
little, black carrying case just to fit, and
Mrs. Delight can take it to the beach.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here is your camera, then,”
laughed Mother, tossing it up the
stairs into Betsey’s two hands.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good-bye, Mother,” sang Betsey,
bustling back into the playroom.
“Ding-ling! Hello! Give me three-five-one,
please.” (This in Mr. Delight’s
pleasant deep voice.)</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hello, Mr. Betts. Can you make
me a camera to take with me to the
beach?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>“I can, sir. I will send it up with
the suit-case, and bag, and fish-pole.”
And Mr. Betts hastily got out his
glue and heavy paper and thin sticks
of wood, and soon finished a gentleman’s
hand-bag, lettered “J. D.” (for
John Darling), a tiny black camera,
and a long, slender fish-pole.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There!” said Betsey to nobody
in particular. “<i>Here</i> is where the
beach will be.” (Setting up the
new cottage.) “Here is the station.”
(Setting up the train of cars.) “And
here are all the new things to be
delivered.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She packed them into a tiny express
cart drawn by a brown horse, took a
last look at the room to see that
everything was ready, and went down
to dinner.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>“Norah,” she said, settling herself
at the table all alone in the big dining-room,
“I’m going to be very busy all
the afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are ye, me darlint!” said Norah
with a smile. “And do you want
anything of me?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Betsey hesitated. “No, I guess
not—unless you could find me a big
shingle. Do you think you could?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A big shingle! I’m thinking
there’s a cellar full! I’ll give ye
two for a kiss!”</p>

<p class='c012'>But as it turned out, Betsey gave
two kisses to kind Norah for one
shingle, and hurried back to her playroom,
calling back over her shoulder,
“I want the shingle for a wharf!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A wharf,” chuckled Norah to herself.
“Bless the dear child! She has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>a regular little town up in her room,
with her houses, and her cars, and
her seashores!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Betsey stopped in her mother’s
room and looked hard at the washstand.
“Yes, I’ll be very careful,”
she said to nobody in particular, and
lifted the pitcher out, and poured the
white pond-lily bowl nearly full of
water. “It’s lovely and cold!” she
giggled. “How Mr. Delight will
yell!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Carefully she lifted the basin, and
slowly she walked to the back hall.
“However am I going to open the
door?” puzzled Betsey. But she
got no farther, for one of her wrists
let down suddenly, and splash! went
a great shower of water over the floor,
and began running in all directions.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“I should have called Norah,” said
Betsey. But she did not sit down
and watch the water creep down-stairs.
She seized a dry mop, and
dried the floor very deftly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m glad I didn’t break the bowl,”
she thought as she squeezed the dry
mop (which was now quite a wet one)
out of the window. “It’s lucky the
back hall isn’t carpeted.” And she
started out again.</p>

<p class='c012'>This time she reached the playroom
safely, set the “ocean” on the table by
the beach, and knelt down before the
big house to help Mrs. Delight ring
her shiny telephone.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hello, Prudence. What do you
say if we go to the seashore?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, you take my breath away!
John and I haven’t any bathing-suits.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“But suppose William and I see
to that?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, we haven’t hired a cottage.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But suppose we see to that, too?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then we’ll go! Shall we meet
you at the station?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Meet us at ten, sharp!”</p>

<p class='c012'>With these words Betsey took Mrs.
Delight from the telephone, put on
her prettiest white suit and her hat
trimmed with the blue-jay feather that
she had found in the yard. She tied a
wide blue ribbon to Dumpling’s collar,
put on Mr. Delight’s gray derby, and
packed the suit-case neatly. Then she
hustled the whole crowd to the station,
taking three dolls in one hand and two
dolls and a dog in the other. As the
little ladies were kissing each other
delightedly, Betsey gave a shrill whistle
and rushed the big, noisy engine swiftly
along the track, and brought it slowly
to a standstill. Then she gave several
hard puffs (the way an engine does,
you know).</p>

<p>“SOON MR. DELIGHT CAME STRIDING BACK”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>“Woof! Woof!” said Dumpling.</p>

<p class='c012'>“O here’s a dog,” said the porter,
catching hold of Dumpling’s blue
ribbon. “No dogs allowed in de
Pullman, sah.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dis yeah dog is!” said Dinah,
forgetting herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, miss; all dogs hab to ride in
de baggage car.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My dear Edith,” said Mr. Delight
calmly, “I’ll go and see my friend,
the President of the Railroad, and see
what can be done.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“De train will go off and leave you,
sah!” cried the distressed porter.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>“No it won’t, William!” shouted
Mr. Darling. “I’m going to stand
right here with my bag, directly on the
track, and the engineer won’t dare to
run over me.” And Betsey stood Mr.
Darling up, right under the nose of
the steaming engine.</p>

<p class='c012'>Soon Mr. Delight came striding
back. “It’s all right,” he called.
“The President’s Special will be
hitched on directly. Here it comes
down the track now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Betsey had the biggest passenger
car behind her all the time. In fact
it was the only car all the little people
could get into all at once, and now she
pushed it down the track at a great
rate and bumped it into the train with
a bang quite like a real passenger car.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is a shame that it will be too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>late to bathe when we get there,” said
Mrs. Delight, as Betsey arranged them
all in the tiny green velvet seats.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It won’t,” corrected Mr. Darling.
“Eleven o’clock is the fashionable
hour to bathe. The minute I get there
I shall put on my bathing-suit. And,
Dinah, I shall get enough fish for
dinner off the wharf before I touch
the water.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Better not promise, Mr. John.
What if de fishes don’t bite?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I promise,” said Mr. Darling more
firmly, “that I won’t go into the water
until I get enough fish for dinner.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Here Betsey slowed up the train,
and called out in a conductor’s loud
voice, “Beachwood! Beachwood!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here we are,” cried Mr. Delight.
“What a lovely cottage!”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>But Betsey couldn’t wait for them
all to exclaim over the new cottage,
having four grown-up people to dress
in new bathing-suits, so she began
directly with Mr. Delight. She put
on his cunning blue bath-robe over his
bathing-suit and tied the tiny cord
carefully, because Mr. Delight was
cold-blooded, like Father. Mrs. Delight
had a round rubber cap (not
really rubber, though), and Betsey tied
Mrs. Darling’s hair up in a white silk
bandana with a funny knot in front,
like Cousin Margaret’s. As for Mr.
Darling, he had a scarlet suit, just the
color of a boiled lobster. And Betsey
slung the fish-pole over his shoulder,
and gave the new camera to Mrs.
Darling.</p>

<p>“REMEMBER DE FISH, MR. JOHN,” CALLED DINAH</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>“Remember de fish, Mister John,”
called Dinah. “Nebber tech de
water twell you catches enough fo’
dinner!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll bring you the fish, sure!”
promised Mr. Darling.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here’s the wharf,” said Betsey,
putting the big shingle across the
bowl. “Mr. Darling can fish while
the others try the water.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You know the best way to go in,
Prudence, I suppose?” said Betsey
for Mrs. Delight, settling herself
before the table that held the ocean.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, you wet your forehead first,
like this,” said Mrs. Darling, “and
then you just plunge in all over like
this! O-o-eee!” And Betsey laughed
and sputtered just as everyone does at
the seashore, giving a monstrous shout
for Mr. Delight when he went in.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>“Don’t stir up the water so much
down there!” called Mr. Darling
from the wharf. “Scared away a big
cod, then.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wonder if I could make Mr.
Delight swim,” thought Betsey. She
bent out his tiny arms and lowered
him into the water and tried to make
him strike out. But she forgot that
she had very carelessly left Mrs.
Darling standing in the water, and
Mr. Delight was so very awkward
and made such a huge wave, that the
water in the small ocean struck her
full in the face and over she went.</p>

<p class='c012'>“O her hair! her hair!” cried
Betsey in distress, plunging her hand
in after the poor little lady. She
hastily dried her in a big towel, and
took off the little silk cap to see what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>damage was done. “It isn’t so bad,”
she decided, feeling of the yellow braid.
“The silk made very good rubber.
Now Mr. Darling can go in.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And she plunged him in all over.
The other dolls were greatly surprised.
“We didn’t know you had caught a
fish,” they said.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Go and look in my fish basket,”
said Mr. Darling.</p>

<p class='c012'>And when they looked in the basket
they found two tiny paper blue-fish
that Betsey had secretly cut out and
hidden there.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We must take them to Dinah
to cook. I am starved,” said Mrs.
Delight, climbing out.</p>

<p class='c012'>Betsey had just about time enough
to get the family dry and dressed when
Dinah called them to dinner. “It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>will be all right if Mrs. Darling’s hair
<i>is</i> down to dry,” decided Betsey.
“Cousin Margaret has to dry hers.”
And she set them around the table.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I didn’t know blue-fish grew
here,” said Mrs. Delight.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Pshaw! Don’t let him fool you,
honey,” said Dinah scornfully. “I
seed him out on de wharf wid de
fish man when you-all was busy in de
water.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He didn’t catch them at all, then,”
said Mrs. Delight.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” said Mr. Darling. “But you
know I said I’d <i>get</i> the fish; I didn’t
promise to catch them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And Betsey had to laugh herself to
see them laugh. And as she laughed
she heard a familiar voice call, “Betsey,
dear!”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>“Why, mother can’t be home,” she
cried.</p>

<p class='c012'>But she opened the door and it
surely was Mother who stood on the
landing with her arms out ready for
her busy little daughter.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You may come down and look in
my bag,” she said, kissing Betsey.</p>

<p class='c012'>And when the black bag was opened,
Betsey found two tiny boxes for her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know when they’re tiny, they
are for Mrs. Delight,” she giggled,
as she unwrapped the tissue papers.
Inside she found a beautiful little gilt
cuckoo-clock with a tiny bird who
really said “cuckoo” when you pulled
a cord,—and two smooth, silver-framed
mirrors.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Those mirrors,” said Betsey, almost
too pleased to speak, “mean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>that Mrs. Delight will have to have
a new bureau.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But it really turned out to mean a
great deal more,—which is another
story!</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>Chapter III<br /> MR. DELIGHT’S SURPRISE</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>“Where is my happy, sunny,
good-tempered, busy little
daughter Betsey?” asked Mother
playfully, one morning.</p>

<p class='c012'>“She’s ’way inside of me,” said
Betsey, dolefully. “So far I can’t
find her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What drove her in?” inquired
Mother, tossing away her duster and
sitting down on the couch.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think Mary’s going away to the
country drove her in,” replied Betsey,
slowly. “She’s going tomorrow and
stay five weeks!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why-e-e!” exclaimed Mother.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>“If here isn’t a tear! A great, big,
round, wet tear! Whatever shall we
do?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Betsey laughed a little, and wiped
her eyes with Mother’s soft handkerchief.
“But you see I won’t have
anyone to play with,” she said, “and
I shall be lonesome.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What about Mary?” suggested
Mother. “Don’t you think she’ll be
lonesome too? Now I think this
would be a good plan,—the very first
moment you begin to miss Mary, just
begin to make something nice to
send her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“O I think so, too!” cried Betsey.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now I see somebody coming
back,” declared Mother. “It’s my
happy, sunny, good-temp—”</p>

<p class='c012'>But Betsey began kissing Mother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>so hard that it was impossible for her
to finish.</p>

<p class='c012'>About a week after this, Mr. Betts
sat in his shop making an automobile.
He had made the biggest part out of
a candy box, had covered it smoothly
with black oilcloth, and had fastened
a fascinating number on the rear,—the
very number that was on Father’s
own car. But Mr. Betts was having
rather a hard time with the head-lights.
He was almost on the verge of getting
out of patience with the machine,
when luckily the mail came. And
there was a little letter from Mary.</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Dear, darling Betsey (it said),</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>I miss you dreadfully. I play every
minute with Mr. and Mrs. Merrill,
and I have made a lovely summer
house for them right on the bank of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>the really, truly brook. So they go
bathing every day. I wish Edith
could make Leslie a visit. Wouldn’t
it be great?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Betsey read the letter through twice.
When she came the second time to
the sentence, “I wish Edith could
make Leslie a visit,” an idea so exciting
and pleasant came to her that she
laughed and danced a little hornpipe
around the room.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll <i>send</i> her! I’ll put her in a
box!” she declared to nobody in
particular. “I’ll pack her clothes in
a box, and put her in the center so she
won’t break, and then I’ll write what
every dress is for!” And Betsey
dashed down-stairs with the letter to
consult with Mother.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mother liked the exciting idea. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>even stopped rolling out pink sugar
jumbles to find a large shoe-box for
Betsey, and some heavy paper and
cord. And then what fun it was
selecting costumes to send with Mrs.
Delight! For this was really going
away, not just Make-Believe, although
Make-Believe does very well, when
one hasn’t a real friend in the country.</p>

<p class='c012'>Betsey first packed Mrs. Delight’s
satin and chiffon evening dresses, her
opera cloak, and her outing clothes;
her dainty muslins and her frilly night-dress
and her pink kimono. Then
she dressed Mrs. Delight herself in her
green Norfolk suit, settled her in the
soft bed, and packed over her white
petticoats by the dozen, a woolen
blanket for cold nights, sofa pillows,
and hats. Then she wrote a letter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>to Mary saying that Mrs. Delight
could stay a week, and mailed them
together.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now, to tell the truth, Betsey had
been thinking all this time of how
pleased Mary would be, and she
hadn’t yet thought how lonesome she
would be, or how <i>extremely</i> lonesome
poor little Mr. Delight would be!
And when at last Mr. Betts came back
to finish his automobile, it began to
dawn on him how quiet his shop was.
He laid down the little wheel and
looked over at poor Mr. Delight lying
on the dining-room floor. And then
the dignified carpenter changed suddenly
into a very disconsolate little girl.
Just at this minute, Betsey was very
sorry she had sent Mrs. Delight away.</p>

<p class='c012'>She ran her fingers through her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>yellow curls and began to think. She
thought how sad and lonesome Father
had been the year Mother had taken
Betsey and Tom on the big ship to
England, and how the house looked
when they came home again. Not
that it was untidy, O no! There was
the new piazza, and the grand new
music room, and Betsey’s own room
done over in soft rose-color and white.
And another such brilliant idea popped
into Betsey’s head that she laughed
aloud.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mother heard the laugh down in the
pantry and smiled, and Norah heard
it in the kitchen and grinned broadly.
And Joe, the gardener, heard it out in
the stables, and laughed too.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll let Mr. Delight get up a surprise!
I can make Mrs. Delight her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>new bureau with my new mirror, and
he can order two new bedrooms and
a bathroom, if the old bookcase is
anywhere near the right size!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Here Betsey jumped up and ran for
the old bookcase as fast as she could
go. It was a funny bookcase. Father
had “knocked it together” once, in a
great hurry. The two shelves did not
reach the back of the bookcase at all,
which left a space for the books to fall
backward in the most bothersome way.
But it was lucky for Betsey that Father
had left this space, or there would have
been no doors between Mr. Delight’s
new bedrooms. Betsey laid the bookcase
on its side and measured it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Did you ever!” she cried. It measured
exactly the same as the doll-house.</p>

<p class='c012'>“So you wish to surprise your wife?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>said Mr. Betts, cheerfully rubbing his
hands as if nothing had happened.
He set Mr. Delight comfortably in a
little chair on the table.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I do,” replied Mr. Delight. “We
would like to have company, and really
need a guest room.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The first thing, then,” proceeded
Mr. Betts, “is to select wall-paper
and clap it on.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And for clapping it on,” said Betsey,
giggling, “I will need paste.”
She skipped down-stairs to see what
Mother would think about making
paste on baking day. And she had
a feeling besides that the pink sugar
jumbles <i>might</i> be done.</p>

<p class='c012'>The jumbles were done, but Mother
was nowhere to be seen. “A caller,”
said Norah.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Now, if Norah hadn’t been cross,
she would have said, “A caller, me
darlint,” and Betsey knew it. She
took a delicate bite out of a jumble
and began cautiously, “Good deal
of cooking going on, isn’t there,
Norah?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A big sight of it,” agreed Norah.
“But it’s me that is equal to it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Norah,” said Betsey suddenly,
“do you happen to know how paperhangers
make their paste?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Flour,” said Norah, “stirred in
cold water; then hot water till it’s just
right. It’s many the time I’ve made
it for me brother Terence.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m thinking,” said Betsey
thoughtfully, “of papering a new
room.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Norah stopped wiping a milk bottle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>put her hands on her hips, and laughed
heartily.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’re the cute darlint! <i>Will</i> I be
after making ye some paste? Yes, and
I will, if the pies never get made!”
And kind Norah sifted the flour and
stirred and stirred, until she could
hand Betsey a bright tin pail full of
hot paste as smooth as cream. And
when she saw the smile on Betsey’s
face, she was thanked enough.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Betts walked into his shop with
his pail, and put on a long-sleeved
blue apron. He selected a long paintbrush,
and a can of white paint.</p>

<p class='c012'>“While my paste cools,” he said,
“I will begin the marble floor in the
bathroom.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A marble floor!” exclaimed Mr.
Delight. “How extremely rich!”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>“Betsey, Betsey! What on earth
do I smell?” called Tom.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You smell Mr. Delight’s marble
floor,” replied Betsey.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hum,” said Tom, gazing at
the tiny room fast growing white.
“Which will you have, right or
left?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“O I love to guess,” cried Betsey.
“Right!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Better guess right <i>and</i> left,” said
Tom, holding out both hands. In
one was a white china mustard-boat,
and in the other, a half a hollow rubber
ball. “I found them out in the
rubbish box, and it struck me that
the mustard-boat would make a good
bathtub,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And the ball will make a set-bowl!”
cried Betsey.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>“Good,” said Tom admiringly. “I
never should have thought of a set-bowl.
Paint the inside white and set
it in a square of cardboard.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And I’ll paint the pipe that holds
it up with silver,” said Betsey, “and
hang one of my new mirrors over it!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The next day when Betsey was happily
doing all these things, the mail
came. Such a fat letter as Mary sent!
One sheet was from Mrs. Delight to
her busy little husband, only she didn’t
know he was busy, and thought he
must be nearly dead from lonesomeness.
And she said at the end of her
tiny letter: “I am so afraid that you
are lonesome, I have almost decided
to come right home.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Betsey instantly rushed for her doll’s
paper and envelopes with Mr. Delight’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>tiny monogram on them, and wrote as
fast as she could, in Mr. Delight’s bold
hand-writing,</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“My dearest Edith,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>I am not the least bit lonely, and
should feel very badly indeed if you
were to cut your visit short. So don’t
come until the week is up.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Your devoted husband,</div>
      <div class='line in14'>William.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Then she read Mary’s letter. “The
dolls are just loads of fun,” Mary
wrote. “I have made them a little
sleeping-tent beside ours, and they
sleep out doors with me, and you
were such an old dear to send Mrs.
Delight. Hasn’t she the loveliest
clothes?”</p>

<p class='c012'>And just at this moment Betsey was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>very glad indeed that she had sent
Mrs. Delight away. But the letter
reminded her that Mrs. Delight would
be away only three days longer, so she
fell to work again.</p>

<p class='c012'>Such a patient little worker was
Betsey! She measured the pretty
wall-paper carefully, and pressed out
every bubble of paste with a soft cloth,
so that her walls were very workmanlike
indeed. She always stood Mr.
Delight up in his shirt-sleeves in the
room she was at work in, to superintend
things in general.</p>

<p class='c012'>Out of a sweet-smelling box that
had once held three cakes of soap,
Betsey made Mrs. Delight’s green
ruffled bed. Then she drew chickens
with real ink on the pillow-sham
of the guest-room bed, and printed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>BATH-MAT in bright red, in the
center of the dear little rug, to be laid
beside the new tub.</p>

<p class='c012'>One morning when Betsey was
making up the tiny new beds with the
fresh new sheets and embroidered
blankets, Tom came up two stairs at
a time with a large shoe-box. “Mrs.
Delight arrived on this train!” he
cried.</p>

<p class='c012'>“O don’t undo her yet!” pleaded
Betsey in great distress. “The house
isn’t ready for her to see yet.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So Tom good-naturedly left the box
untouched.</p>

<p class='c012'>Anxious as Betsey was to see her
dearest doll again, she kept steadily
at her delightful work arranging furniture,
until everything was in readiness.
Then she stood Dinah up in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>the dining-room with a tiny pitcher
of lemonade, settled Mr. Delight and
Dumpling in the new touring-car, and
whizzed them away to the station.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then she unpacked the shoe-box.
“How surprised she will be,” sang
Betsey, as she burrowed for Mrs.
Delight. “Oh, oh! What beautiful
new clothes! And Mary made them!”
She held up one shimmering dress after
another,—one trimmed with tiny beads,
and one with embroidery. “Now Mr.
Delight can be surprised too!”</p>

<p class='c012'>And at last she came to the pretty
little lady herself. Betsey set her hat
straight and stepped her off the train.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Woof! Woof!” said Dumpling.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How glad I am,” cried Betsey in
Mr. Delight’s deep bass voice.</p>

<p class='c012'>“O see the new car!” said Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>Delight’s silvery voice. And Betsey
laughed as she lifted the little china
dog in beside his mistress.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How cute they look!” she
cried, clapping her hands. Then
she whizzed them as fast as she
could to the big green house.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You can go down at once to your
room, my dear,” said Mr. Delight.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You mean <i>up</i>,” said Mrs. Delight.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, he mean down, honey,” said
Dinah with a welcoming grin.</p>

<p class='c012'>So Mrs. Delight went down-stairs
in great astonishment to find the
bright, new rooms. She looked first
at her beautiful bed, and then at the
bathroom and the guest chamber.</p>

<p class='c012'>“O William, this is why you didn’t
want me to come home. You are the
very kindest man in all the world!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_062f.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“SO MRS. DELIGHT WENT DOWN IN GREAT ASTONISHMENT TO FIND THE BRIGHT NEW ROOMS”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>And the funniest thing! Although
Betsey had done every bit of the work,
and Mr. Delight hadn’t done a single
thing, she was not the least bit jealous
when she went down-stairs to dinner!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>Chapter IV<br /> THE PICNIC</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>“What on earth is Betsey doing
with that <i>pail</i>?” asked Cousin
Margaret in amazement. She and
Mother sat one afternoon in the
cool sewing-room as Betsey passed
the door lugging a pail of soapsuds.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Betsey, what are you up to? Cleaning
house?” she called, laughing.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Just so,” replied Betsey, coming
back slowly and setting her steaming
pail on the floor. “You see, Mrs.
Delight’s house needs a <i>thorough</i>
cleaning all over before company
comes, so today Dinah and Mrs.
Delight clean house.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“You funny child!” said Cousin
Margaret, letting her dainty work fall
to the table. “Do you mean to say
you really scrub?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Scrub!” echoed Betsey, lifting
her pail again. “Say, come on up
with me and see!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Cousin Margaret was very young
and very pretty, and she really didn’t
have the slightest idea how one cleaned
a doll-house. So with a little wink at
Mother, she followed Betsey up the
stairs.</p>

<p class='c012'>When she saw Betsey’s collection
of house-cleaning materials, she sank
weakly into a big chair and stared.
There was a stiff brush, and a soft
brush, and a cake of sapolio; a
whole basketful of soft cloths, and
a chamois skin.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>“What’s the chamois skin for?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“To clean the mirrors,” said
Betsey.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, I do declare!” was all
Cousin Margaret could say. But
pretty soon she leaned forward and
began to watch Betsey with a little
secret admiration. Mrs. Delight was
already dressed in one of her fresh
morning dresses, white apron and
ruffled sweeping cap, and she and
Dinah were supposed to be moving all
the furniture into the drawing-room.
Mr. Delight sat stiffly on the window-seat
and watched.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You see, Cousin Margaret,” explained
Betsey, “Mrs. Delight’s twin
sister and her husband are coming to
visit. (Those are Anne’s old dolls she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>lets me take.) And Mr. Delight is
going to the post-office to mail the
invitation. <i>I’ll</i> tell you,—I’ll put him
in the car with Dumpling and make
Mrs. Delight and Dinah wave to
him, and then you can attend to
him while I clean house. Water’s
getting cold!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How stylish and proper he do
look,—a-driving dat kerridge!” suddenly
observed Betsey in Dinah’s
pleasant voice.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, Betsey, how you scared me!
I thought you really were another
person!” exclaimed Cousin Margaret,
looking up from the post-office. But
when she once looked up from the
post-office she couldn’t look back
again, for there was Betsey on her
knees, going at the little house with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>the largest scrubbing-brush as if the
dirt were inches thick.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’ll take the paint off!”
screamed Cousin Margaret.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Take the paint off!” echoed
Betsey. “Just see here.” She doubled
her cloth over a skewer and began
digging out the corners of the
little dining-room windows. And
when the room was clean enough, she
wiped the smooth floor vigorously
back and forth with a clean cloth.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now see the difference,” she
announced, looking first at the clean
dining-room and then at the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, the other is actually gray,
isn’t it?” said Cousin Margaret,
peering in at the little room. “Don’t
you want to let me do this one?”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_068f.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“HE SURE DO LOOK MIGHTY STYLISH A-DRIVING DAT KERRIDGE,” SAID DINAH</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“O thank you!” cried Betsey,
seizing the carpets to shake out of
the window. So Cousin Margaret
promptly began her first house-cleaning.
As she polished off the threshold,
she heard a gentle thud, thud,
over by the desk, so she took her head
out of the house to see what was going
on. There sat Betsey beating pillows
with two of the tiniest little carpet-beaters
you ever saw. They were made
of twisted wires, exactly like big ones,
only so small that they made you
laugh to look at them. Cousin Margaret
laughed. But she had to own
up that the rooms looked very fresh
and sweet, as they put back the clean
carpets and dusted furniture.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What does your Mrs. Delight do
to entertain her guests?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>“I thought they could have a
picnic,” said Betsey, pausing a moment
to think. “I have a pattern for
a dandy lunch-basket. And Tom has
the dearest little canoe!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Has he, indeed?” observed Tom’s
voice around the corner.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’ll lend it, won’t you?”
pleaded Betsey.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It makes a good deal of difference
what it’s wanted for,” replied Tom,
with his hands in his pockets.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, the Delights are going to
have a picnic, and they go to a certain
grove, like Brighton’s Lake, you
know, where they have canoes to
rent. And I have everything but the
canoe, Tom.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Everything?” questioned Tom.
“Have you a Thermos bottle?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>“Hum!” said Cousin Margaret
loudly. “I’ll make the Thermos bottles
for you,—one quart size, and one
pint. I’d love to!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How are you going to make
them, Cousin Margaret?” asked Tom
respectfully.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If you children will come down
street with me, and show me the
nearest gum machine,—the kind where
the gum is done up in silver paper,
you know,—I’ll let you watch me!”
bargained Cousin Margaret, determined
now to make a perfectly wonderful
article.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What does she want gum for?”
giggled Betsey, scurrying down-stairs
behind Tom.</p>

<p class='c012'>“She wants the silver paper,” said
Tom wisely.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>And that was exactly what she did
want at the time, but when the happy
trio stood before the red machine in
the grocery store, and the thin stick of
gum came shooting out into Cousin
Margaret’s hands, she had another idea.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come, we’ll buy three sticks, and
I’ll hire you to chew one apiece,” she
said. “Peel off the silver paper without
tearing it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t like gum after the wintergreen
flavor goes,” said Betsey,
chewing hard.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You can’t have it anyway,” said
Cousin Margaret severely. “Didn’t
I buy it for my quart bottle?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’re going to <i>mold</i> it!” cried
Betsey, skipping along the sidewalk.
“Aren’t you clever!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mother smiled when she saw them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>go upstairs again, and she went quietly
out to the pantry without saying a
word.</p>

<p class='c012'>Cousin Margaret sat down at Mr.
Betts’ work-table with a mighty puff.
She smoothed away on the bright tin-foil
until it shone like solid silver.
Then she molded her soft chewing-gum
carefully into a tiny pint bottle.
She clipped off a long strip of tin-foil
and wound it around the bottle,
pinched the top a little, and glued on
a paper label.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Keeps cold twenty-four hours!”
she cried, holding it out for inspection.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good!” shouted Tom and Betsey.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hand over your gum, children,”
said Cousin Margaret. “It takes two
for a quart. You can be making the
lunch-basket.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“Weren’t you going to play tennis
this afternoon?” asked Betsey
thoughtfully. “Mother said I mustn’t
bother you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I was, but I’m <i>not</i>,” replied
Cousin Margaret recklessly. “I’d
rather play picnic, and sail your canoe
in the bathtub.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Tom slipped quietly down-stairs at
mention of the bathtub, and neither
the little girl nor the big girl noticed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“O William, here come Prudence
and John!” cried Cousin Margaret in
Mrs. Delight’s silvery voice, rushing
Mrs. Delight to the front door.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here we are!” shouted Betsey
for Mr. Darling. “It’s so much fun
to have somebody else manage all
these dolls, Cousin Margaret!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Suppose you manage the Delights,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>suggested Cousin Margaret
in an undertone, “and let me have
the company.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’d rather,” said Betsey, joyfully,
taking charge at once of Mr.
Delight, who was not helping his
guests properly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Keep your dog off!” said Cousin
Margaret, making Mr. Darling rush
at Dumpling in the most ridiculous
manner.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are you tired, Prudence?” asked
Mrs. Delight.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tired? No!” said Mrs. Darling.</p>

<p class='c012'>Betsey made Mr. and Mrs. Delight
look at each other.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, what’s up?” questioned
Mr. Darling, sitting down on the
tiny piano stool.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We thought,” began Betsey in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Mrs. Delight’s most charming manner,
“that we might go on a picnic.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hoo-ray!” cried Cousin Margaret,
making Mr. Darling turn a
splendid handspring across the little
parlor.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, John, I am ashamed of
you,” said Betsey, sternly, for his wife,
and trying in vain to stop laughing.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I brought my camera that has
legs,” said Mr. Darling, “and I’ll take
your pictures.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We haven’t really a camera with
legs, have we?” whispered Betsey.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Down in my trunk,” said Cousin
Margaret. “You begin to dress them
in picnic clothes, and I’ll get it. I
meant to save it until I went home,
but I know you’d rather have it now.”
She struggled to her feet, and left
Betsey tying a soft blue ribbon around
Mrs. Delight’s fluffy head. The
camera proved to be a fascinating tin
one, with a front part that pulled in
and out beautifully.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_076f.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“TAKE UP A SANDWICH AND LOOK PLEASANT,” SAID MR. DARLING</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>“Let’s hurry. I’m hungry already!”
said Cousin Margaret, piling everything
into the little touring-car,—basket,
dog, Dinah, and shawls, helter-skelter.
The car whizzed around the
room a few times, and stopped with a
jolt at the picnic grounds.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Spread the shawl on the ground
about here,” directed Mrs. Delight,
pointing with the tip of her slipper to
a little clearing. “Strew the cushions
around, and—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Open up the lunch!” interrupted
Mr. Darling, setting up his camera.
“I don’t want to take my picture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>until the eating begins, and the sun
is about right now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“His old picture is just an excuse
to eat”, remarked Mrs. Darling.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Better give de ole dog sump’in to
eat. Den he won’t be boddering so
much,” said Dinah.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, let me see,—he’s had twelve
cookies,” reflected Mrs. Delight.
“Give him three more and let him go
over on that little hill to eat them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Can’t he hab apple dumpling?”
asked Dinah anxiously.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Give Dumpling Delight a delightful
dumpling,” sang Mr. Darling.
“Now, all ready! Take up a sandwich,
Mrs. D., and look pleasant!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now let’s take them down to the
lake,” suggested Betsey, poking the
last crumb under Dumpling’s muzzle.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>When they reached the big, white-tiled
bathroom, they found the bathtub
filled with water, a wharf across it,
and a beautiful, dark green sailboat
floating gracefully up and down with
the waves. And the waves were so
very lively that it seemed as if someone
must be quite near. Betsey glanced
behind the door.</p>

<p class='c012'>“O here’s the Mr. Wind that made
the waves,” she said gaily, pulling
Tom down to the lake.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Will somebody kindly notice
the boat-house?” said Tom, kneeling
down good-naturedly.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a plank across the tub,
wide enough to drive the little motorcar
along, and at the further end stood
a tiny cardboard ticket-window. Behind
the little bars, made of toothpicks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>stood a paper ticket-man in a
blue cap. And overhead was printed:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“CANOES $1.00 AN HOUR</div>
      <div class='line'>SAILBOATS $5.00 AN HOUR”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Isn’t that grand?” cried Cousin
Margaret. “<i>We</i> can afford the green
sailboat as long as the Delights are
millionaires.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Tom grinned, and watched the big
girl and the little girl seat the happy
dolls safely in the big boat. And
when it was finally untied and sailed
slowly off down the lake, it looked
exactly like a real boat party of sober
grown-up people.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It actually made me sort of hungry,”
said Cousin Margaret at last,
“to see them eat at the picnic. Let’s
go down and get a gingersnap.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Tom grinned again. “Mother said
when you were through playing, to
come to her upstairs piazza.”</p>

<p class='c012'>With one accord the two girls carefully
placed the picnic party safely on
the wharf and skipped for the piazza.
There sat Mother, in her prettiest
company dress of soft white crêpe,
smiling at nobody in particular, but
looking at the green wicker tea-table.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wow!” cried Tom. “If Dumpling
were here, he’d say ‘Woof!’”</p>

<p class='c012'>On the tea-table were pink plates of
thin sandwiches, and a huge glass
pitcher of strawberry-ade with real
strawberries floating in it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wish you would pour, Margaret,”
said Mother, smiling.</p>

<p class='c012'>So Cousin Margaret, with a sly wink
at Betsey, took her place very sedately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>and poured the frosty glasses full,
and passed the sandwiches. And she
did it so very well, and with such a
grown-up air, that Betsey wondered
how in the world Cousin Margaret
could be a little girl so easily.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>Chapter V<br /> THE CHRISTMAS TREE</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>Betsey was sitting on the slippery
couch looking quite serious. She
was not Mr. Betts today, nor even Dr.
Betson. She was just a little girl with
a sore throat, watching the big, real
Dr. Lawrence as he rummaged around
in his black bag. He put up his
uncomfortable glass spoon that he
pressed down one’s tongue with, and
fished out an oblong pasteboard box.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh!” said Betsey.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dr. Lawrence looked up quickly.
“Why do you say ‘Oh!’ Sister?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>Betsey’s eyes were fastened on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>little box. “It’s <i>just</i> the shape of a
Victrola,” she said.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hmmmm!” buzzed the big doctor,
taking the cover off and dropping
in some tiny pink tablets and some
large white ones. “If you will take a
white pill every hour, and gargle a
pink one (dissolved in water, of
course) every <i>half</i> hour, you shall
have the box! And——hullo! Here’s
a bit of wire just about right for a
crank! Now, Mr. Tom, we’ll do up
your burned thumb.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Tom had been experimenting a little
too much with Norah’s teakettle and
the steam had made quite a big blister.
Dr. Lawrence unrolled a sheet of pure
white absorbent cotton.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh!” said Betsey.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, deary me!” cried Dr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Lawrence, pretending to be quite put
out. “I suppose the child wants my
cotton, too. Mr. Avery, make Betsey
stop saying ‘Oh!’ I won’t have a
thing left to give the little girl down
the road, if this child takes all my
pills, and boxes, and wire,—and now
my cotton!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Betsey slipped off the couch and
danced around happily. She loved to
hear Dr. Lawrence joke. “It makes
such perfectly beautiful snow,” she
said. “And just imagine my little
automobile plowing along in it,
making wheel-ruts just like yours.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, I suppose you’ll have to
have it,” said Dr. Lawrence, resignedly.
“I’ll charge your father for it,
though,—see if I don’t. And poor
Tom what will he do?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>“O you can have enough for his
thumb,” said Betsey.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hmmmm!” buzzed on the doctor,
winding away. “Down the road
is a little girl nine years old. She has
three dolls, and they’re about as long
as Tom’s thumb.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tom Thumb!” interrupted Betsey.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes’m,” laughed Dr. Lawrence.
“Well, this little girl Molly has a
lame knee,—a very lame knee, and I
had to send her to bed for a month.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A <i>month</i>!” echoed Betsey.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Does it seem long to you?” asked
Dr. Lawrence thoughtfully. “That’s
just how it seems to her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Does Molly play with her dolls?”
asked Betsey.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, she sews for them, but they
each need a party dress.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>“Can’t she make party dresses?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“O yes, she <i>can</i>, if she has the
proper materials. Now, you see a
party dress requires some thin sort of
fuzzy cloth——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You don’t mean fuzzy, Dr. Lawrence,”
interrupted Betsey, smiling.
“You mean soft and drapey.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s it. I see <i>you</i> know what a
party dress is made of. And perhaps
some ribbons and a little piece of lace.
How about that?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Betsey crossed the room, took one
of the doctor’s big hands in both hers
and gave it a hard squeeze. “I think
you’re a perfectly lovely doctor, and
I saw just what you were driving at
all the time. And don’t you <i>dare</i> to
go before I come back.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And she went directly to the playroom,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>opened Madame Bettina’s box
of cloth, and looked over its contents.
She finally selected a dainty rosebud
muslin with a pink border, a thin
dimity covered with wreaths of tiny
forget-me-nots, and a pretty yellow
voile. She pulled out a length of
baby ribbon to match each dress, and
a handful of soft lace, and folded the
whole carefully in white tissue-paper.
Then she went down-stairs with such
a sudden thought in her curly head
that she sang a little tune all the way.</p>

<p class='c012'>She burst into the library with
her little parcel to find Dr. Lawrence
talking and laughing with Father, and
putting on his big fur coat.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What’s up?” he asked, catching
sight of Betsey’s shining face.</p>

<p class='c012'>“<i>Could</i> you wait a minute?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>begged Betsey. “You see, Mr. and
Mrs. Delight are going to have a
Christmas tree and invite some poor
little children. And I want to write
an invitation to Molly’s three dolls!
She could send the dolls over by you
when you come this afternoon, and
perhaps I can take them back myself
tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good enough!” said the doctor
good-naturedly, sliding out of his coat
again. “Molly will be so glad she
won’t know <i>what</i> to do. I’ll wait.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Betsey climbed in haste into the
big desk chair and wrote carefully on
her blue notepaper:</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_089.jpg' alt='Mr. and Mrs. William Delight request the honor of your company at a Christmas Party on December 24th at three o’clock.' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>And on the little blue envelope she
wrote, “For Molly’s three dolls.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will deliver it directly,” said
Dr. Lawrence, “and this afternoon I
will bring the company.” And he
blew a kiss to Betsey for thanks.</p>

<p class='c012'>The moment the doctor had gone,
Mr. Betts went to his shop and began
on his Victrola, for this was to be Mr.
Delight’s present to his wife. Mr.
Betts cut the slender legs with a sharp
penknife and bent out the tiny doors.
Then he pasted shiny dark-red paper
all over the outside and pushed in
the crank.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It <i>almost</i> looks as if it would
play,” declared Betsey. Then she
took a white pill and gargled a pink
one, for she always kept her promise.
Then all was ready.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_090f.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“HE LEFT A PRINT OF EACH TINY FOOTSTEP”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>“O William!” said Mrs. Delight,
sitting down on the gilt sofa beside
her husband, “don’t you think we could
get the Christmas tree ourselves?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Indeed we could! Put on your
long coat and furs, and I will bring
the car around, and we will find one.”
Betsey spread out the soft white snow
for the forest, and dressed Mr. Delight
in his gray fox coat with its curly
black collar. Then she put on Mrs.
Delight’s long brown coat and fastened
up her lovely ermine furs.
“The little darling!” she said, kissing
her, and settling both the little
dolls in the automobile.</p>

<p class='c012'>The car did make a fascinating rut
in the snow, and when Betsey walked
Mr. Delight over to the hemlock trees
he left a print of each tiny footstep.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Whang! Whang! resounded his
tiny axe. Finally the tree toppled over
with a delightful thud,—it was only
the very tip of Betsey’s real tree which
stood down-stairs ready for lighting.</p>

<p class='c012'>“O the sweet little tree!” cried
Betsey, seizing it, and, I am sorry to
say, leaving the little couple stranded
in the forest.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll set it in one of my wooden
circles that seam-binding comes on,
and cover it with green crêpe paper.”</p>

<p class='c012'>First she cleared all the furniture
out of the little drawing-room and set
up the tree. Then she began to wind
her shining tinsel and paper chains
around it, and hung on her dazzling,
colored glass balls, blue and red, and
green and gold. And then she hung
presents by the dozen on it. A tiny
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>rocking-horse and a sled, she had to
place at the foot of the tree.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You poor things!” she exclaimed
at last, catching sight of Mr. Delight
lying on his back in the snow. “You
must come and get dressed in time for
your own party.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think, William,” began Mrs.
Delight enthusiastically, “that I will
wear my blue accordion-plaited
crêpe-de-chine.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And I will wear my dress-suit,”
said Mr. Delight, as Betsey slipped
his tiny cuffs up his sleeves.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You can stand here,” said Betsey,
setting up the host and hostess by the
little Victrola, “and then you will be
all ready when the children arrive.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And she went down to get ready
herself.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>“Don’t you think it would be nice,
Betsey,” said Mother, as she buttoned
Betsey’s blue cashmere dress, “if you
should make a few clothes for Molly’s
children? Just some odd things like
a kimono or a sweater?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m going to,” said Betsey happily,
nodding her curly head. “I
have an old gray golf-glove that I can
make a sweater of,——the wrist for the
sweater part, and two fingers for the
sleeves.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s my kind daughter,” said
Mother, approvingly. “Now run
down and let the doctor in.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“<i>Here</i> are those three children!”
cried Dr. Lawrence, holding out a
square box. “Please hurry and take
them! Bless me! I didn’t take a minute’s
comfort for fear I should smash
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>them to bits! Can I come to the
party? How’s the throat?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Betsey laughed at his list of
questions and opened her mouth
obediently.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Fine! Fine!” said the doctor,
peering at the throat over his spectacles.
“Christmas day will find you
as well as ever. Now, for that, can’t
I come to the party?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“If you’d like to,” said Betsey, her
eyes dancing, for she knew that Dr.
Lawrence would make the best playmate
a little girl ever had. And she
led the way with Molly’s dolls, all
dressed in the new party dresses,
made since morning by the delighted
Molly,—every stitch by hand.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, what a fine man your Mr.
Delight is!” declared Dr. Lawrence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>sitting down heavily in the big chair
before the doll-house.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He is. He doesn’t drink or
smoke,—just like Father, you know,”
said Betsey.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I should know that to look at
him,” said Dr. Lawrence. “And
what a pretty little wife he has, to
be sure!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here come the children, William,”
cried Betsey in Mrs. Delight’s
sweet voice.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, yes, my dear!” boomed Dr.
Lawrence hastily, taking a tiny Dutch
boy and a Kewpie doll out of his
pocket. “I found two more poor
children, Edith, and brought them
along. They live in the alley!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“O lovely!” said Betsey, admiring
the Kewpie’s white fur suit. “Let’s
show them the tree the very first
thing.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_096f.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“DINNER AM SERVED, SAH,” DRAWLED DR. LAWRENCE, POKING DINAH’S HEAD BETWEEN THE PINK PORTIÈRES</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>And as the children stood speechless
around the tree, Betsey and her
playmate untied parcel after parcel,
introduced the Dutch boy to his new
sled, and laughed to hear Dumpling
growl at the rocking-horse.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dinner am served, sah,” drawled
Dr. Lawrence, poking Dinah’s head
between the pink portières.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Get into line, then, children,”
giggled Betsey, “and march into
the dining-room.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Eight dolls are quite a handful for
even two people to attend to, but
Betsey and the doctor finally managed
to seat the five children around the
big table and get them all waited upon
by Dinah and Mrs. Delight. Betsey
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>had made a big paper brick of ice
cream, made up of tiny cubes of different
colors, exactly like the big one
that was waiting down-stairs for her
own Christmas dinner.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’re a mighty good cook, missus!”
piped up Dr. Lawrence for the
Kewpie, rolling his eyes at Dinah.
Just then the nursery clock struck four.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Bless my soul! I must go!”
shouted Dr. Lawrence, getting up in
a great rush and nearly upsetting the
whole house.</p>

<p class='c012'>“O I’m sorry!” said Betsey, following
him down-stairs,—“but I’m
very much obliged for this short call.
And tomorrow can I go and take
Molly’s dolls back to her?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think you may. If you gargle,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>The two entered the library where
Father and Mother were seated.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I never saw a little girl in all my
life,” said Dr. Lawrence to nobody
in particular, “who played so charmingly
with her dolls. Now I have a
little niece who had the greatest doll-house
last Christmas that you ever laid
eyes on. It was just perfect. Little
marble-topped tables, and desk telephones,
and <i>clothes</i>—! Why, her
dolls had so many clothes they didn’t
know what to do. And all made,—every
one of ’em,—all finished. I
never used to understand why she
didn’t play with ’em. And now,”—he
made a low bow to Betsey,—“now
I know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Because she didn’t have anything
to make?” questioned Betsey.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>“Exactly so,” said Dr. Lawrence.
“Elise had nothing to do but dress
and undress those dolls. She couldn’t
talk for them because there was nothing
to say. In fact, I’d like to give a
perfectly <i>bare</i> doll-house to every little
girl I know. I wouldn’t give her a
single piece of furniture, or any money
to buy it with, either.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Betsey has had just a dollar this
year for baby ribbon and tissue-paper
and white cardboard,” remarked Mrs.
Avery with a smile.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, then, for only a dollar,”
replied Dr. Lawrence, “you are learning
many good lessons, Mistress
Betsey, with your sewing and carpentering,
and laying rugs. And I
hope you will play dolls until you’re
quite grown up!”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>And now (this being a true story),
if you would like to know how old
Betsey was when she finally covered
up the House of Delight, and packed
away her dear little dolls, just turn
this page and hunt for a tiny figure
hidden in one corner!</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 2. The Mission of Project Gutenberg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 4. Donations to PGLAF">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 5. Project Gutenberg Electronic Works">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
